Description: Provides a bootstrapping and ensemble framework for supervised
    learning analyses using multiclass classification algorithms for modelling,
    prediction, and evaluation. Predicted classes are evaluated under metrics
    such as log loss, AUC, F1-score, Matthew's correlation coefficient, and
    accuracy. Discrimination and reliability plots visualize the classifier
    performances.
Depends: R (>= 3.2.0)
