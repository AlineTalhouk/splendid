Description: Provides a bootstrapping and ensemble framework for
    supervised learning analyses using multiclass classification
    algorithms for modelling, prediction, and evaluation. Predicted
    classes are evaluated under metrics such as log loss, AUC, F1-score,
    Matthew's correlation coefficient, and accuracy. Discrimination and
    reliability plots visualize the classifier performances. The .632+
    estimator is implemented for the log loss error rate.
